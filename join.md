### Exploring the role of alternative splicing in glioma progression

Gliomas are the most common form of cancer in the central nervous system, arising from glial cells such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells. Gliomas are classified grade I to grade IV based on histologic features (Wen and Kesari N Engl J Med 2008). Glioblastoma, a type of grade IV glioma that arises from astrocytes, is one of the deadliest of human cancers, with median survival of 14 months after maximal surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy (Stupp et al. N Engl J Med 2005).

In this project, you will use publically available data and in-house bioinformatics tools to explore the roles of alternative splicing, especially a type of it called intron retention, in 272 glioma patients (Bao et al. Genome Res 2014). You will identify whether retention of specific introns in specific genes is associated with features such as cancer subtype, disease activation pathway and poorer prognosis. Observed splicing events will then be evaluated to assess whether they could be broadly applicable as novel disease biomarkers for diagnostics, or serve as druggable targets for personalized medicine therapy.  

We are seeking motivated students of computer science or computational biology who want to apply methods involving pattern recognition of ‘Big Data’. You will be joining a team of passionate researchers at the Centenary Institute. If you are interested, come and visit us!

### Uncovering patterns of gene regulation in human disease via bioinformatics 

The Gene and Stem Cell Therapy Program, led by Prof. John Rasko, recently identified a previously unknown mechanism of gene regulation that may help to understand mechanisms underlying human disease. An innovative experimental technique prototyped in our group allows us to study gene regulation at a level of detail that has not been achieved before. The aim for this honours project is to analyse RNA sequencing data (Illumina/PacBio platforms) and search for patterns of alternative splicing. Furthermore, we will analyse if these patterns are evolutionarily conserved and/or can be used as biomarker for disease diagnosis/prognosis. Parts of the analyses will be performed on a High Performance Computing system.

### How does altered chromatin organisation lead to ovarian cancer?

Ovarian cancer is the deadliest gynaecological cancer, and affects 1300 women each year in Australia. We have found that over 80% of ovarian cancers carry mutations and/or deletions in the CTCF gene. CTCF is a DNA binding protein that plays a critical role in epigenetics and gene regulation. CTCF is known widely as the “master weaver of the genome”. We have previously shown that CTCF can act as a tumour suppressor gene. We will employ expression of cancer specific CTCF mutants and/or CTCF knockdown in ovarian cancer cell lines. These cell lines will then be used in various biological assays including cell growth, colony formation, apoptosis, cell morphology, stem cell, gene expression and chromatin conformation assays, to elucidate the role CTCF in ovarian cancer development and progression.

### The role of intron retention in acute myeloid leukaemia

**Supervisors**: <a href="j.wong@centenary.org.au" target="_top">Doctor Justin Wong</a>, Professor John Rasko

Background: In 2013, we reported in the prestigious journal, Cell, that a mode of alternative splicing termed intron retention (IR) is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism regulating normal gene expression via nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Subsequent to our original discovery in human and mouse myeloid cells, we and others have demonstrated IR as a widespread mechanism that controls transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) in many different cell types. We now seek to determine the unexplored role of IR in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), a malignant counterpart of granulocyte differentiation. AML is a serious life-threatening disease. Recent discoveries of mutations affecting splicing factors that control mRNA splicing in AML suggest this disease is affected by splicing perturbation; leading to aberrant IR.

The Project: The project builds on our extensive preliminary data that aberrant IR is a prevalent RNA splicing defect in AML. Using publicly available datasets and primary AML samples, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to curate intron-retaining transcripts in AML. The candidate will also explore the role of IR in controlling the expression of AML-related genes via the NMD pathway. Using in vitro and in vivo models, there will also be the opportunity to determine if IR could lead to the formation of new proteins in cases where intron-retaining transcripts escaped NMD. This project will improve the understanding of IR as a novel factor in AML, which may lead to the development of improved therapeutic strategies.

#### Techniques:

* Next-generation sequencing (particularly Illumina mRNA-sequencing, PacBio Sequencing)
* Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
* NMD inhibition assays (using RNA interference and chemical approaches)
* Mass spectrometry
* Western Blotting
* Retroviral-mediated gene transfer
* Animal models
* Bioinformatics

### Unravelling abnormal gene expression to understand breast cancer

Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting Australian women, comprising over 14,000 women and 100 men each year. We have found that over half of breast cancers carry mutations and/or deletions in the CTCF gene. CTCF is a DNA binding protein that plays a critical role in epigenetics and gene regulation. CTCF is known widely as the “master weaver of the genome”. We have previously shown that CTCF can act as a tumour suppressor gene. In this project we will characterise the specific contribution of CTCF gene deletion to breast cancer. To achieve this aim we will target CTCF expression using small hairpin RNA molecules targeting CTCF in breast cancer cell lines. These cell lines will be grown using 3D spheroid culture techniques to analyse cell morphology and stem-cell properties by performing 3D imaging on confocal and deconvolution microscopes.

### The role of IKZF1 (IKAROS) in acute myeloid leukaemia

#### Background

IKZF1 or IKAROS gene is alternatively spliced to produce multiple isoforms of zinc finger proteins. These proteins are known to bind to promoter regions of genes to regulate gene expression. IKAROS is crucial for normal hemapoiesis and has been reported to be a tumour suppressor gene. However, the role of this gene has mainly been studied in the development of lymphoid lineages and malignancies. The role of IKAROS in the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is currently unclear. There is uncertainty concerning the predominant isoforms of IKAROS expressed in AML. A recent study using xenograft models showed that dominant-negative Ikaros cooperates with BCR-ABL1 to induce human AML; raising the possibility that aberrant expression of IKAROS may be a cause of AML that is currently ignored.

#### The Project

The project will utilise targeted long RNA transcript sequencing technology from PacBio to identify predominantly expressed IKAROS isoforms in AML patient samples compared to normals. The candidate will also explore the possibility that IKAROS expression is reduced in AML through sequence mutations and epigenetic regulation. Using in vitro and in vivo models, he or she will also be determining if altered expression of IKAROS will result in increased oncogenic potential. This project will improve the understanding of aberrant IKAROS gene expression as a novel cause of AML, which may lead to the development of improved therapeutic strategies.

#### Techniques:

* Next-generation sequencing (PacBio + Illumina + Ion Torrent Sequencing)
* Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR
* DNA methylation analysis (bisulfite sequencing, quantitative methylation-specific PCR)
* Retroviral-mediated gene transfer and transfection
* Animal models and related assays (flow cytometry, microscopy)

### Molecular techniques to study the three dimensional architecture of the genome

CTCF is a DNA binding protein that plays a critical role in epigenetics and gene regulation leading to it being called the “master weaver of the genome”. One of its many roles in the cell nucleus is to form chromatin loops at a large number gene loci which act to switch genes on and off. We have found that CTCF is mutated or deleted in diverse common cancers. This project will investigate the effect of CTCF knockdown on chromatin structure at several cancer-associated gene loci using Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) and correlate this with changes in gene expression. 3C is a sophisticated molecular biology technique already established in our laboratory. 3C is used by us to characterise the folding of chromatin at gene loci and the structural organisation of chromosomes. We will explore the role of CTCF in the regulation of gene expression using this and other techniques.
